# Oscillating-Cylinder
This Matlab program analyzes a cylinder oscillating in an infinite tank using a given streamfunction. It creates 2-D and 3-D videos of the streamlines and streaklines of the flow a period of 2.5 seconds.
The program consists of a script and a function, and it generates a single video file.
The script contains the logic of the program.
The function contains the streamfunction, solved using Newton's Method, and a cartesian->polar->cartesian conversion.
